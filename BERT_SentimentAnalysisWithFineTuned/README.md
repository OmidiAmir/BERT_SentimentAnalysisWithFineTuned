In this project I fine tune the BERT model using the SMILE Twitter Emotion dataset for sentiment analysis. 
The project includes 
  - Data preparation
  - model and the tokenizer and encoder loading
  - Training (fine tuning) the model
  - evaluating the fine tuned model. 

I use the pytorch framework in this project.
